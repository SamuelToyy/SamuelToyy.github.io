### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was a favorite because I always wanted to make a guessing 
    game like Hi-Lo. I learned how to have the user input a number and 
    initialize and output if it was higher or lower. It was this Lab that was 
    the sparking point and was when I started to understand C++.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because I was able to make a sandwich with 
    vectors, command line arguments, and for-each loops. I was able to use 
    vectors to input strings that would output the ingridients in the sandwich 
    recipe. Coding the input validation was a keen task for me to do that I 
    enjoyed.
    

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because I thought coding to find a palindrome 
    was easier than I thought. I was wrong. It got more complicated for me when it came to 
    reading from another file. Coding how to reverse the string really made me think 
    outside the box which is why it is one of my favorites.
